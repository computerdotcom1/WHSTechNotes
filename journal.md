Writing Prompt --- How is Computer Science used, and how does it affect my own personal day to day life ?
I mean , we have coding in our everyday life . Also what's used to make our clothes sometimes. It's kinda cool how that happens.

A job that I have researched before that I could possibly might as well end up doing in the future is coding for a future game for my friend and I and others that would
work on the project. I haven't really thought about the costs because that might as well be fluctuating with between how me and my friend and others decide between 
if our game ever grows from indie to huge. It's interesting to think about, but of course, that thinking is for much more later on. Lalala

Writing prompt --- How can coding help with problem-solving skills ?

I think it can help by simply showing how things work in simpler terms in a way. Let's take true = 1 and false = 2. It makes sense with that, but if we have it as both true and false equal 1, then it isn't
really helping them to be defined, since both of them equal the same thing. That would be a problem that can easily be fixed by saying true = 1 and false = 2, and we make sure they're kept that way
for all the other things that we'll use them in the future for . Let's take it to a real life example -- if I have it as "If I clean my room, my room will be clean."

clean room = room clean

It's a simple little process made easy. Could even pair them together.

clean room = room clean
true = 1

And we paired them together, and they look equally nice together. How lovely. ^_^

Writing Prompt --- Talk about how bad [and good] A.I can be .

That's the thing --- from what I have purely seen myself, A.I can be absolutely terrifying. It's mostly because A.I has gotten so uniquely similar to art styles and music producing and even writing that it might as well just be used as a replacement for a person, and that person just stays at home, doing <nothing>, and still getting money for their "work" that they have done [which may as well age as good as soured milk in the long run] . A.I can only be used really to be used to help with references, and things like that, but we already taken it too far by using it to replicate art that takes artists months or even years to draw. Especially with A.I animation starting to run about. It's kind of weird.


Should probably save it [Reminder]
