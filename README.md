A job career that most interests me is character designing for games. I haven't really thought about it much,
since I was mostly planning on designing characters for my friends, but I feel as if it'll be fun, lovely to do.
I don't really think there's much on what I really need for it,
besides the skills of creativity, drawing, and communication for what my client/friend wants. :-]
